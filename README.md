# SpaceX-Capstone-Project
Predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
